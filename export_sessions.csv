293,Talk/Track C/Programming,Introducing xrprof: A New Way to Profile R,"Tracking down performance issues in R code usually means using R's built-in Rprof() profiler or one of the packages built around it. But the changing nature of the R community (towards more deployed applications) makes local profiling workflows frustrating, which is why I have written a new profiler: xrprof.

xprof is compatible with existing R tools, but unlike them it can be used to profile R code that is already running -- in fact, it is designed to be safe to point at R code running ""in production"". xrprof also works seamlessly when R is run inside Docker, and can even be run in complex environments like Kubernetes clusters.

Taking inspiration from the {jointprof} package, xrprof can also show function calls at the C/C++ level alongside those from R. This can be immensely useful for diagnosing problems in packages that make heavy use of compiled code.

Since the Haiti 2010 earthquake, the volume of data collected and used by humanitarians has been growing exponentially and organizations are now relying on data specialists to turn all this data into life-saving data products.

These data products are created by teams using proprietary point and click software. The process from the raw data to the final data product involves a lot of clicking, copying and pasting and is usually not reproducible.

Another approach to humanitarian data science is possible using R. In this talk, I will show how to seamlessly develop reproducible, reusable humanitarian data products using the tidyverse, rmarkdown and some domain-focused R packages.

224,Lightning Talk/Track C/Modelling,Categorical Embeddings: New Ways to Simplify Complex Data,"When building a predictive model in R, many of the functions (such as lm(), glm(), randomForest, xgboost, or neural networks in keras) require that all input variables are numeric.  If your data has categorical variables, you may have to choose between ignoring some of your data and too many new columns.

Categorical embeddings are a relative new method, utilizing methods popularized in Natural Language Processing that help models solve this problem and can help you understand more about the categories themselves.

While there are a number of online tutorials on how to use Keras (usually in Python) to create these embeddings, this talk will use embed::step_embed(), an extension of the recipes package, to create the embeddings.

163,Lightning Talk/Track B/Organisational tooling,Custom theming in Shiny &amp; R Markdown with bslib &amp; thematic,"Custom theming in Shiny and R Markdown often requires writing styling rules in both CSS and R. In particular, styles for HTML content (e.g., actionButton(), tabsetPanel(), titlePanel(), etc) derive from Bootstrap CSS, so customization is traditionally done by overwriting that CSS, which is difficult to do 100% correctly. The {bslib} package helps solve this problem by making it easy to customize (any version of) Bootstrap CSS defaults from R. However, this only solves part of the problem since CSS doesn't necessarily effect output(s) rendered by R, such as plotOutput(). The thematic package helps solve this problem by providing auto theming of plotOutput()s (based on CSS) as well as a simple interface for styling any R graphic for any output format.

315,Talk/Track C/Modelling,"Fairness and Data Science: Failures, Factors, and Futures","In recent years, numerous highly publicized failures in data science have made evident that biases or issues of fairness in training data can sneak into, and be magnified by, our models, leading to harmful, incorrect predictions being made once the models are deployed into the real world. But what actually constitutes an unfiar or biased model, and how can we diagnose and address these issues within our own work? In this talk, I will present a framework for better understanding how issues of fairness overlap with data science as well as how we can improve our modeling pipelines to make them more interpretable, reproducible, and fair to the groups that they are intended to serve. We will explore this new framework together through an analysis of ProPublica's COMPAS recidivism dataset using the tidymodels, drake, and iml packages.

That’s right – the almighty, mysterious, coveted production.  From a technical perspective, the app is nothing particularly special (except other than getting LaTeX successfully installed to support the use of R Markdown). Users enter a few parameters and out pops a PDF with a series statistical analyses of a product’s quality testing data. The R blogosphere is filled with examples of similar Shiny apps.

What mattered was the app was in production, and furthermore it was approved for GMP use.  This meant these reports could be submitted to the FDA and other regulatory agencies. This meant the data could be used to support product release decisions. This meant Merck’s engineers were about to save thousands of hours per year in compiling data, generating charts, and calculating summary statistics. This was the app manufacturing sites needed.

Most of the work in getting this app into production was not implementing the top-level features. Sorry, no discussion of fancy statistical process control methods here. Instead this talk will discuss some of the many things the development team (none of which came from a software development background) needed to learn in order to create a robust, secure, and maintainable production application.

261,Talk/Track A/Learning,Aesthetically automated figure production,"Automation, reproducibility, data driven. These are not normally concepts one would associate with the traditional publishing industry, where designers normally manually produce every artefact in proprietary software. And, when you have 1000s of figures to produce and update for a single textbook, this becomes an insurmountable task, meaning our textbooks quickly become outdated, especially in our rapidly advancing world.

With R and the tidyverse in our back pocket, we rose to the challenge to revolutionize this workflow. I will explain how we collaborated with a publishing group to develop a system to aesthetically automate the production of figures for a textbook including translations into several languages.

I think you’ll find this talk interesting as it shows how we applied tools that are familiar to us, but in an unconventional way to fundamentally transform a conventional process.

214,Talk/Track A/Teaching,"On programming, teaching, and building interactive tutorials with learnr::","Teaching R is part of my activities as a community organizer, an RStudio Certified Instructor, a conference chair, and a researcher. Since 2019, I use the learnr package to generate interactive tutorials to teach R synchronously and asynchronously. The addition of the Tutorials panel in RStudio IDE and the need for virtual classes made the use of this package even more interesting. In this talk, I will tell you how to generate interactive tutorials, how to add pedagogical tools to them, what other packages you can use with {learnr} and show multilingual examples.

114,Lightning Talk/Track C/Programming,Easy larger-than-RAM data manipulation with {disk.frame},"Learn how to handle 100GBs of data with ease using {disk.frame} - the larger-than-RAM-data manipulation package.

R loads data in its entirety into RAM. However, RAM is a precious resource and often do run out. That's why most R user would have run into the ""cannot allocate vector of size xxB."" error at some point.

However, the need to handle larger-than-RAM data doesn't go away just because RAM isn't large enough. So many useRs turn to big data tools like Spark for the task. In this talk, I will make the case that {disk.frame} is sufficient and often preferable for manipulating larger-than-RAM data that fit on disk. I will show how you can apply familiar {dplyr}-verbs to manipulate larger-than-RAM data with {disk.frame}.
