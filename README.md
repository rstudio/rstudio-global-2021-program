This repository contains files relating to the Program and Schedule for [rstudio::global 2021](https://rstudio.com/conference/). It includes:

-   The "master data" about speakers and talks

-   Scripts for converting that data to YAML for downstream processes to consume

## Instructions for speakers

1.  Find your Markdown file under the `speakers/` directory.

    1.  Ensure the existing metadata is correct, and fill out any of the `null` links. (Do not add additional fields, they will be ignored.)

    2.  Edit the talk title and abstract.

    3.  Fill out the speaker bio paragraph.

2.  **Provide a square headshot** by uploading a .jpg or .png to the `speakers/` directory. The filename must match your Markdown file, except for the file extension. (For example, Sean Lopp has `speakers/seanlopp.md`, so his headshot would need to be `speakers/seanlopp.jpg` or `speakers/seanlopp.png`.)

3.  Submit your changes as a PR and someone on the program committee will approve ASAP.

You may submit as many changes/PRs as you want, up until the deadline of [TODO].

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask on the [\#rstudio-global-2021-speakers Slack channel](https://rstudio.slack.com/archives/C01CWSPESJD) or file an issue!
