# Cognitive speed and how the Tidyverse is helping the British Red Cross respond quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic

We will discuss the importance of cognitive speed, defined here as the rate in which an idea can be translated into code, and why the Tidyverse excels in this domain. We will demonstrate this idea in relation to a suite of tools we were required to rapidly develop at the British Red Cross in order to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic. To do this, we will exhibit how elements of the unifying design principles outlined in the ‘Tidyverse design guide - Tidyverse team’ relate to the notion of cognitive speed, giving specific examples from our tools. We believe this talk will encourage reflection on better design practices for future R developers, using the design principles of the Tidyverse as the guiding beacon.
