# The power of Great Datasets

There are a few classic datasets, like mtcars or nycflights. They're okay, but they leave something to be desired for folks learning R: they're kind of boring.

There's a big difference between Okay Datasets and Great Datasets. Great Datasets prompt you to exclaim, "That's so cool!" They get your blood pumping and mind racing with questions you want answered. They give tremendous motivation to answer those questions. And in answering those questions, you'll probably learn some R.

I want you to curate Great Datasets. You'll contribute to the richness of our community, you'll learn some R yourself, and you'll feel fantastic when someone finds your Great Dataset and exclaims, "That's so cool!"
