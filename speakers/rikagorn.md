# From Zero to Hero: Best practices for setting up Rstudio Team in the Cloud

Learn best practices for setting up the entire Rstudio team infrastructure - Server Pro, Connect, Package Manager from the perspective of a data scientist and for a data science audience - especially those who have never worked with servers, AWS, or bash. I started out as a complete novice, & throughout my learning experience I noticed a distinct lack of resources for non-engineers. This talk will focus on best practices for AWS architecture and cloud formation, key security issues such as SSL and https, server configurations, deployment errors, and most importantly resources that are understandable for data scientists just getting into the data engineering or devops space.
