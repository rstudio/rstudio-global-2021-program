# How Content Makes the Data Go 'Round

What makes a successful data science community thrive across industries? A recent Aflac WorkForces Report showed that professionals who are engaged in a community within their industry are 70% more likely to be satisfied with their work. 
 I believe anyone can and should create content about data. In this talk, I will direct your attention towards 1) the ways that content creation can lead to heightened data science opportunities 2) how to know which type/s of content mediums (podcasts, blogs, video) are right for you 3) how to leverage social media and networking connections to make your content reach the right audiences. I hope to inspire listeners to create their own content and online brands as resources for fellow R community members.
