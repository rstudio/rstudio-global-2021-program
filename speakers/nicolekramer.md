# A New Paradigm for Multifigure, Coordinate-Based Plotting in R

R is unparalleled in its ability to transform raw data into a wide array of beautiful graphics, all within the same environment. However, when it comes to complex, multi-paneled plots, users rely on 3rd party graphic design software to arrange plots. Here I present the new world of programmatic, coordinate-based multi-figure plotting in R. Employing grid Graphics and drawing from the paradigms of base plotting and ggplot2, I am developing a package that will revolutionize the way plots are laid out in R. Not only will individual plots be aesthetically customizable and tailored for speed, users will also be offered exquisite control over all aspects of page layout, plot placement, and arrangements. Come join me in changing how we plot in R!

# Speaker bio

Nicole Kramer is a third year [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](https://bcb.unc.edu/) graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She works in the [lab of Dr. Doug Phanstiel](http://phanstiel-lab.med.unc.edu/), where her and her colleagues use experimental and computational techniques to study human genomics. Prior to grad school, Nicole received her B.S. in Biological Engineering from MIT in 2018. When not doing science, you can find Nicole petting dogs, admiring giraffes, or knitting tiny animals!
