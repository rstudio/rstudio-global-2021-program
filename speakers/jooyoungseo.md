# Accessible Data Science Beyond Visual Models: Non-Visual Interactions with R and RStudio Packages

Data science is full of vision-dominant practices, and most data scientists rely heavily on visual models. 

However, data science itself should require insight and computational thinking beyond what is just seen by eyes.

JooYoung Seo, who is a blind data scientist and who was working for RStudio's accessibility projects over the summer 2020, will talk about his experience with some non-visual techniques to interact with data.

If you would like to know more about various ways of making data science accessible via R, and new accessibility features introduced in RStudio IDE and Shiny, his demonstration without sight will be thought-provoking.

# Speaker bio

JooYoung Seo is a Ph.D candidate in the Learning, Design, and Technology program at the Pennsylvania State University, and internationally certified accessibility professional whose research and development focuses on accessible computing for all. As an RStudio's double-certified data science instructor (i.e., Tidyverse + Shiny), who is blind, he is committed to making data science ecosystem more accessible to people with and without dis/abilities using R. To this end, he has been actively contributing to R open-source projects including `{shiny}`, `{rmarkdown}`, `{bookdown}`, and `{distill}` for accessibility, and interned on the RStudio IDE and Shiny team as an accessibility engineer in summer 2020.
