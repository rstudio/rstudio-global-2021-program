# Art Lessons: One Year as RStudio’s Artist-in-Residence

Art can be a welcoming bridge for learners and users to engage with tools and skills in R. As RStudio’s first Artist-in-Residence, my goal has been to make the R landscape more welcoming for a broader community of users through engaging, didactic artwork. In this R, art, and heart-filled talk, I’ll share lessons learned as Artist-in-Residence through anecdotes and - yep - illustrations, including what I’ve learned about: 

- Joining the R community as a creative contributor
- Cartoons aren’t just for kids: embracing cuteness to personify code
- How illustrating R makes me a better R user and teacher

By the end of this talk, I hope that more R users feel inspired to create and share their own artwork to foster a more inclusive R universe.
