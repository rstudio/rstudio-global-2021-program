# R & Python: Going Steady

There has been a lot of excitement about the R and Python love story. This talk will focus on the day-to-day aspects of their blossoming relationship. We'll cover tips and tricks for combining the two languages inside RStudio as well as tools for multi-language teams using and RStudio' professional products.

NOTE: the game plan would be a rapid fire talk following in the footsteps of Jonathan's always popular "tips and tricks" talk. Python interpreter, REPL, and environment pane in RStudio. Jupyter/VS Code in RSP. PyPI in RSPM. All the Python things in RSC.
