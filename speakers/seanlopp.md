# R & Python: Going Steady

While there has been a lot of excitement about the R and Python love story, there are still misconceptions that individuals, teams, or organizations must pick between R or Python. This talk will explain why this false choice exists, debunk the myths that cause teams to be stuck with only one tool, and clarify how data scientists can use both languages to be more effective. We will explore this love story's blossoming relationship by looking at updates to RStudio's packages and products that make it easier to develop and collaborate in R and Python. This talk is for individuals who want to uncover the benefits of multilingual data science, IT professionals who are skeptical their life can get better by supporting more languages, and data science managers interested in enabling their teams instead of forcing their data superheros to be subservient to particular tools.
