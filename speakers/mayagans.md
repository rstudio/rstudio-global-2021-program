# Starting an R Book Club: Cooking Up Friendships in Isolation

Amidst a global pandemic there’s been one consistency in my life: every Tuesday a group of friends meet to discuss Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R. I crowdsourced interest using the R4DS Slack and the results were magical: a group of incredibly curious and generous people motivated to learn and teach one another emerged. The meetings evolved from a group of strangers giving timid presentations to a safe space where we share and improve upon personal applications. The 1 club has grown to 3 regional cohorts, and became a model for discussing other books too. This talk will go over the structure of our meetings in hopes of empowering others to start their own book clubs, showcasing a different way people can create and engage in communities.
