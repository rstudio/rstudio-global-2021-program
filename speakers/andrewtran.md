# The Opioid Files: Turning big pharmacy data over to the public

Just because data is public doesn't mean it's accessible. It takes more effort, but designing data distribution so it can be analyzed by people with differing levels of data analysis skills opens up the possibility of more stories that can be told. This talk will go over how The Washington Post used R (and Python) to analyze hundreds of gigs of pain pill distribution data from the Drug Enforcement Administration as part of its investigation into the opioid epidemic. And how making the data public and showing their work enabled other journalists and researchers across the country to drill deeper than the Post could ever do on its own.
