# oRganization: How to make internal R packages part of your team

Many case studies demonstrate the benefits of organizations developing internal R packages. But how do you move your organization from individual internal packages to a coherent internal ecosystem?

This talk applies the jobs-to-be-done framework to consider the different roles that internal tools can play, from unblocking IT challenges to democratizing tribal knowledge. Beyond technical functionality, we will explore design principles and practice that make internal packages good teammates and consider how these deviate from open-source standards. 

Finally, we will consider how to exploit the unique challenges and opportunities of developing within an organization to make packages that collaborate well -- both with other packages and their human teammates.
