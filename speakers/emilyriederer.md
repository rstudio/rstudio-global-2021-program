# oRganization: Building an R package-verse for your org

Many case studies demonstrate the benefits of organizations developing internal R packages. But how do you move your organization from individual internal packages to a coherent internal ecosystem?

This talk will define an ontology of internal tools that meet different jobs-to-be-done, from unblocking IT challenges to democratizing tribal knowledge. 

Next, we will explore design principles and practices for internal packages and consider how these deviate from open-source standards due to organizations’ unique opportunities and constraints.

Finally, we will demonstrate how an internal ecosystem can maximize its impact by fully leveraging the RStudio IDE, including features like snippets, add-ins, templates, and the new visual editor.
